TWO APPROACHES TO INNOVATION
   1. 'BLUE OCEAN' INNOVATION
   2. FOCUSED, PRAGMATIC INNOVATION

DILEMMA/OPPORTUNITY
   I. CHRONIC CONDITIONS represent 20% 
      INCUR 80% healthcare cost

Week 4 - How to specifiy Needs
    - PRIORITIZING NEEDS
      = Problem Statement
        - semi-quantititive

        - assumptions (accepted fact without verification)
        - identify constraints
      = Need statement
        - non quantitiative statement within a concise statement
      = Rough cut need
        - need statement not really final
      = Good Need Statement
        - focus on primary outcome
        - focus on 1 NEED
        - 25 word
        - does not include solution
        - context is essential

      = Preliminary Need Specification
        I.    Background
        II.   Significance
        III.  Current Methods/Technologies/Solutions
             - Pros and cons
